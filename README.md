<h1>Andr√©s Felipe Fl√≥rez Olivera</h1>
<strong>Principal AI & MLOps Engineer</strong>
<p>Architecting and deploying robust, scalable AI systems that drive measurable business value.</p>
</div>

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Professional Synopsis
I am a senior AI Engineer with over 5 years of experience leading the design, development, and deployment of end-to-end machine learning solutions. My expertise spans the full AI lifecycle, from initial data strategy and model development to productionalization and ongoing operational management (MLOps). I thrive in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and production-grade software, delivering systems that are not only intelligent but also scalable, resilient, and maintainable.

Academic Excellence: I am finalizing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence, which builds upon a strong foundation including certifications from MIT in Data Science & Machine Learning (2024) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Cloud Computing from the University of Texas at Austin.

Leadership & Mentorship: As a co-creator of the Specialization in Artificial Intelligence at UPTC, I designed the MLOps and Deep Learning curriculum and mentored over 100 software developers, successfully launching their careers in the AI industry.

‚öôÔ∏è My Engineering Philosophy
My approach to building AI systems is grounded in three core principles:

Production-First Mindset: I design models and infrastructure with scalability, monitoring, and maintainability in mind from day one. An ML model only provides value when it's reliably serving predictions in a production environment.

End-to-End Ownership: I take full responsibility for the ML lifecycle, from data ingestion pipelines and feature engineering to model training, CI/CD for ML, automated deployment, and performance monitoring.

Pragmatic Innovation: I believe in using the right tool for the job. My focus is on solving business problems effectively, whether that requires a complex deep learning architecture or a simple, interpretable model deployed efficiently.

üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Ecosystem
I am proficient across the modern AI/ML stack, with deep hands-on experience in multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
